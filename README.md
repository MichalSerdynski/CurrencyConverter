# Currency Converter

A simple Java program that converts currency between USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, and AUD using fixed exchange rates.

# Getting Started

To run this program, you'll need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can run the program by executing the following command in the terminal:

Copy code

```java CurrencyConverter```

This will launch the program's graphical user interface (GUI), which allows you to select the currencies you want to convert and enter the amount you want to convert.

# Usage

To use the program, simply select the currencies you want to convert from and to using the drop-down menus, enter the amount you want to convert in the input field, and click the "Convert" button. The program will then calculate the converted amount and display it in the result label.

You can also modify the exchange rates used by the program by editing the getExchangeRate method in the CurrencyConverter class. By default, the program uses fixed exchange rates for demonstration purposes only.
